# SkiaSharp.Extended

A simple way to draw a string that contains icons inline with normal 
characters.

## Building

_Make sure [.NET Core][netcore] is installed._

The root just contains a build script that will build all the other 
scripts. To build everything, just run the command-line:

Mac/Linux:

    $ ./build.sh

Windows:

    > .\build.ps1

If only a specific project, or a set of projects, are to be built, 
then pass a value to the `names` argument:


Mac/Linux:

    $ ./build.sh -names=SkiaSharp.Extended.Iconify

Windows:

    > .\build.ps1 -Names=SkiaSharp.Extended.Iconify
